# Overview

Hello everyone, introducing this is my repository which I dedicated to my completed Data Science Project.

There are two JupyterNotebook files which contain modeling of the available data. In both projects, I used two mainstay techniques for modeling data, namely LinearRegression and KMeans.

After doing modeling, of course I also do Modeling Evaluation using mean_squared_error for LinearRegression and silhouette_score for KMeans, what is my goal? Of course, so that I can always make improvements to the models I make.
