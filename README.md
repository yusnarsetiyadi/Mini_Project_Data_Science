# Overview

Hello everyone, introducing this is my repository which I dedicated to my completed Data Science Project.

There are two JupyterNotebook files which contain modeling of the available data. In both projects, I used two mainstay techniques for modeling data, namely LinearRegression and KMeans.

After doing modeling, of course I also do Modeling Evaluation using mean_squared_error for LinearRegression and silhouette_score for KMeans, what is my goal? Of course, so that I can always make improvements to the models I make.

See the simple executive summary I created in the Executive-Summary.pptx file, see also my presentation for these two projects, [Click Here.](https://www.loom.com/share/c24611fb91614372be4a1f5a9d6bea8c?sid=788cacff-8b6a-4ee0-ac2f-0ed7a4b2ae89)
